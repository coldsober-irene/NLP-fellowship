shortly after the message has been sent keep icons sorted by trash time in rows unfortunately there is a drawback on volume accounting  kppp will only count the number of bytes regardless of their origin many providers set their limit only for internet access and not for data on their own network some providers set different limits for data that is on their own network in the same country and coming from overseas so if youre doing not much websurfing and getting most of your pages from your isps own proxy cache then your provider is probably not charging you for that data  kppp will not know these ip packets are coming from the proxy and so it will count them so if you this situation applies to you or as another example your provider uses a caching news server such as nntpcached then the volume reported by  kppp may be higher than the amount you are going to be billed for on the bright side at least  kppp will never underestimate your bills many games put cards from the talon on a

used in reference to the motion of the outer planets mars jupiter saturn and so forth though these planets appear to move from east to west on a nightly basis in response to the spin of the earth they are actually drifting slowly eastward with respect to the stationary stars which can be observed by noting the position of these planets for several nights in a row this motion is normal for these planets however and not considered retrograde motion however since the earth completes its orbit in a shorter period of time than these outer planets we occasionally overtake an outer planet like a faster car on a multiplelane highway when this occurs the planet we are passing will first appear to stop its eastward drift and it will then appear to drift back toward the west this is retrograde motion since it is in a direction opposite that which is typical for planets finally as the earth swings past the planet in its orbit they appear to resume their normal westtoeast drift on successive nights reference stepsize where  is previous frame  is next frame stepsequence is built together with reference mode parameter the location of the image file used as the icon for the objects button

which may require user interaction in fact all objects emit thermal radiation as long as their temperature is above absolute zero or  degrees celsius but no object emits thermal radiation perfectly rather they are better at emitting absorbing some wavelengths of light than others these uneven efficiencies make it difficult to study the interaction of light heat and matter using normal objects to

textonly systems controlled by keyboard commands  what is known as a commandline interface cli the  xwindow and  kde and other projects have since added the graphical interface you are now using however the underlying cli system is still there and is frequently the easiest fastest and most powerful way to perform many tasks the short answer is this is a temporary limitation there is a problem when constructing the filled polygon that represents the ground when in equatorial mode however it does not make too much sense to draw the ground in equatorial coordinates which is why this fix has been given a low priority calendar view for one or more weeks using commands you tell the turtle or  kturtle to do something some commands need input some give output in this section we explain all

converts the source code to a binary executable and there may be characters having a special meaning within a quoted string in such cases it makes sense to render them differently from the surroundings so that they are easy to identify while reading the text so even if they do not represent special contexts they may be seen as such by the syntax highlighting system so that they can be marked for different rendering whether or not to use encryption this depends on having the openssl linked into the  cups library and scheduler keyboard shortcut key for making font larger expressed as

approach of a language based tool  kommander does not need programming statements to define these operations this makes  kommander quick for developers for end users its much simpler than learning language constructs for everyone it means you can focus on your task instead of having your reference material eternally at hand initially when people are exposed to a tool like  kommander the first question is where could i find a use for this cool tool as it turns out manipulating strings is used just about anywhere you look check this box to show the column letters across the top of each

which is seen as dawn on the surface at the same instant on the opposite side of the earth points are passing from the illuminated half into darkness which is seen as dusk at those locations so at any

however note that antispam tool operations are usually time consuming  kmail can appear to be frozen during the scan of the messages for spam you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of  kmail please consider deleting the filter rules created by the wizard if the filtering becomes too slow for you here are some recommendations regarding the supported tools please note pressing ok will

every developer of a program that was capable of producing printable output had to write his own printer drivers too that was quite complicated because different programs have different file formats even programs with the same purpose for example word processors often do not understand each others formats there was therefore no common interface to all printers hence the programmers often supported only a few selected models autoclose optional tags if checked tags for which closing tag is option will be automatically closed once the tag closing  gt is entered this names a directory

many text jobs will not be in  xml format the page log file has a line for every single page of every job printed exact measurement is possible because of hardware counters including counters incrementing on a time tick provided in modern processors which are incremented whenever an event is happening as we want to attribute events to code regions without the counters we would have to handle every event by incrementing a counter for the current code region ourself doing this in software is of course not possible but on the assumption that the event distribution over source code is similar when looking only at every nth event instead of every event a measurement method whose overhead is tunable has been developed it is called sampling time based sampling tbs uses a timer to regularly look at the program counter to create a histogram over the program code event based sampling ebs exploits the hardware counters of modern processors and uses a mode where an interrupt handler is called on counter underflow to generate a histogram of the corresponding event distribution in the handler the event counter is always reinitialized to the n of the sampling method the advantage of sampling is that the code does not have to be changed but it is still a compromise the above assumption will be more correct if n is small but the smaller the n the higher the overhead of the interrupt handler first of all we will set a camera in order to do so two convenient ways are available heres another screenshot of  ktouch in action this time with a german keyboard and training

of billions of stars that resemble globular clusters on a grand scale they have very little internal structure the density of stars declines smoothly from the concentrated center to the diffuse edge and they can have a broad range of ellipticities or aspect ratios they typically contain very little interstellar gas and dust and no young stellar populations although there are exceptions to these rules edwin hubble referred to elliptical galaxies as earlytype galaxies because he thought that they evolved to become spiral galaxies which he called latetype galaxies astronomers actually now believe the opposite is the case ie that spiral galaxies can turn into elliptical galaxies but hubbles early and latetype labels are still used using this module you can install lilo boot manager add

configure all the keyboard shortcuts which are available in  kappname because of the degree tilt of the ecliptic the altitude of the sun at noon changes over the course of the year as it follows the path of the ecliptic across the sky this causes the seasons in the summer the sun is high in the sky at noon and it remains above the horizon for more than twelve hours whereas in the winter the sun is low in the sky at noon and remains above the horizon for less than twelve hours in addition sunlight is received at the earths surface at a more direct angle in the summer which means that a given area at the surface receives more energy per second in the summer than in winter the differences in day duration and in energy received per unit area lead to the differences in temperature we experience in summer and winter to plot with  kchart when it is embedded in  kspread do the following packages represent a namespace in a programming language in a diagram they are used to represent

finds all text tags and other message strings in the given files and writes the corresponding in calls to standard output so that xgettext can parse them if you plan to develop a complex project it is a good idea to use the  cvs features even if you are the only developer you can make all changes in the working copy and use  cervisia or any other  cvs tool to update and commit this way you will gain the ability to track changes that caused bugs revert changes avoid accidental loss of information  etc using  cervisia it is simple to create a local repository while filters and scoring are very powerful and have many uses one of the most common requirements is simply to add all posts written by someone you do nt wish to read to a killfile at the end of this section is a quick guide to using filters and scores to create such a killfile to send a file to someone in a channel click with the  rmb on the  nickname of the person in the nick panel of the main screen choose send file a dialog appears for you to choose a file to send next a new dcc status tab appears finally the group of controls labeled java runtime settings allows you to set some options for the way in which  java should

button to expand the dialog to include advanced properties if you enter an email address here every article will be sent to the usenet and to this email address now the big question is how to tell the client to pick up the phone when the server calls you back do you need a special program such as mgetty the answer is no you do nt need a special client program in general any client can be used for callback connections you could even use an ordinary terminal program such as minicom to connect you can use the subrepetition button to set up a repetition within a repetition in this case each time the alarm is due as specified in the main recurrence instead of being triggered just once it is triggered repeatedly in accordance with your subrepetition specification for example to set up an alarm which repeats every hour from noon to  pm each thursday you would set up a weekly recurrence on thursday at  and use the subrepetition dialog to specify an interval of  hour and either a count of  or a duration of  hours select at login to trigger the alarm whenever you log in until its scheduled end time then at its scheduled end time it will finally be triggered one last time note that an alarm repeated at login will also be triggered any time you restart  kalarm each line in the text view is normally prefixed with a fd identifier and a time stamp in iso format the fd identifier can be used to distinguish between output from different  gnupg instances running in parallel following the timestamp is the name of the component that is the source of the log line together with some internal

within a specified time period after the right time the time period is selected using controls which appear when you check the box for example if you enter a time period of  hour the alarm will be triggered at the first opportunity up to an hour after it is due but if it cannot be triggered within an hour its activation will be canceled if bad sectors a found during the verify phase of a full format the formatting is aborted and the file system is not written after using  kmail for a while you may find that you have trouble sorting out the new messages in your inbox when they arrive filters allow you to automatically perform certain actions on incoming messages and to manually perform actions on selected messages in a folder to help you view find and export your data you can create and use filters for your calendars for instance if you do not want to view completed todos you can filter them out instead of purging them if you assign categories you can use them to create filters you may only translate web pages that are accessible on the world wide web to translate any other text you should go directly to the babelfish site itself where you are able to paste in text

the detected flux depends on the distance from the source that radiates the energy this is because the energy has to spread over a volume of space before it reaches us let us assume that we have an imaginary balloon that encloses a star each dot on the balloon represents a unit of energy emitted from the star initially the dots in an area of one cm are in close proximity to each other and the flux energy emitted per square centimeter per second is high after a distance d the volume and surface area of the balloon increased causing the dots to spread away from each consequently the number of dots or energy enclosed in one cm has decreased as illustrated in figure  there is also further information available at the kdeedu website most  kmail settings are stored in kdehome  share config

only one condition but you can change this by pressing the more and fewer buttons if you have more than one condition you must tell knode whether all conditions need to be fulfilled or only one of them this can be done by choosing match all conditions or match any condition respectively for example if you have selected several different font faces above and realize they are all a size too big this often happens when you change screen resolution for instance you can apply a new font size to all the fonts without affecting your customized font faces and styles unfreeze the top left of the sheet override for width request of the widget or  if natural request should be used  blinken is based on an electronic game released in  which challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length on the face of the device there are  different color buttons each one with their own distinctive sound these buttons light up randomly creating the sequence that the player must then recall if the player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the correct order they advance to the next stage where an identical sequence with one extra step is presented if they are incorrect the game is lost and the player must start again from the beginning the goal is to get a high score  each step in the sequence is worth one point so correct entry of a sequence of  lights is worth  points on the high score table the contents of your next screen is dependent on your choice in the previous screen if you know the details just type them in to configure your network settings directly

space usage usually  kmail compacts all folders automatically but under certain circumstances you might want to compact a folder manually use the date navigator to go to the event date these drop down boxes lets you determine where on the button in both toolbars the text name of the button will appear as the default if no text is selected then there is no text on the toolbar buttons if text only is selected then the buttons icon is replaced with a text name of the button if text beside icons is selected then the name of the button will be placed to the right of the icon if text below icons is selected the default will be to have the text of the button below the icon when the nickname watcher is turned on you will be notified when the nicknames appearing in the watched networks nicknames list come online or go offline you can also open the nicks online window to see the status of all the watched nicknames edit the file xinitrc in your home folder make a backup copy first remove everything that looks like calling a window manager and insert startkde instead restart the  xserver if you use  kdm  xdm you will have to edit the file xsession instead of xinitrc and if there is no

participants in the newsgroups give hints on their homepage or say that they have intentionally erroneously specified their email addresses in the header fields if you disable displaying the signature you might lose this information on the other hand you might save yourself from reading strange quotes whether the label is drawn in the selected font if true the image will be scaled retaining the aspect ratio of the image to the panel height if horizontal this settings mainly makes sense if one receives and reads news online for local news servers it is of almost no importance if this waiting time is set too low there can be waiting periods if you read a longer article and do not do anything for some time  knode will have canceled the connection to the server by then after the time period has elapsed and has to reestablish it causing a delay it also works for  ppd files just specify the path to the  ppd allows  ktts to begin speaking faster because it need only synthesize the first sentence rather than the entire block of text which might be very long and independently of the users you specify by name you can use the system uids to specify a range of valid uid s that are shown

unix printing method its first version appeared in the early s on bsd  unix and was formally described in rfc  only as late as  at the time when bsd remote printing was first designed printers were serially or otherwise directly connected devices to a host with the internet hardly consisting of more than  nodes printers used holepunched continuous paper fed through by a tractor mechanism with simple rows of ascii text mechanically hammered on to the medium drawn from a cardboard box beneath the table it came out like a zigzag folded paper snake remote printing consisted of a neighboring host in the next room sending a file asking for printout how technology has changed printers generally use cutsheet media they have builtin intelligence to compute the raster images of pages after pages that are sent to them using one of the powerful page description languages pdl many are network nodes in their own right with cpu ram a hard disk and their own operation system and are hooked to a net with potentially millions of users it is a vast proof of the flexible  unix concept for doing things that it made line printing reliably work even under these modern conditions but time has

used in the context of printing rip means a hardware or software instance that converts  postscript or other print formats that are represented in one of the nonraster pdls into a raster image format in such a way that it is acceptable for the marking engine of the printer  postscript printers contain their own postscriptrips a rip may or may not be located inside a printer for many  unix systems ghostscript is the package that provides a rip in software running on the host computer and predigesting the  postscript or other data to become ready to be sent to the printing device hence you may perceive a grain of truth in the slogan ghostscript turns your printer into a  postscript machine which of course is not correct in the true sense of the meaning from  windows clients jobs nearly always need to be sent as raw why if  cups works as a print server for  windows clients using the original native  windows driver for the target print device this guarantees the correct formatting of the job on the clients already therefore the server should not touch it and print raw therefore no filtering is started and this is not even possible as the input from the clients is not  postscript

very flexible so we also provide the ability to execute a  kstars dcop script to set the scene before generating the image the filename you specify as the script argument should be a valid  kstars dcop script such as one created with the script builder tool the script can be used to set where the image is pointing set the geographic location set the time and date change the zoom level and adjust other view options some of the dcop functions make no sense in nongui mode such as waitforkey if these functions are encountered while parsing the script they are simply ignored the properties

developers from different parts of the world in september  the project changed its name from uml modeller to  umbrello there are several reasons for the change of names the most important ones being that just uml  mdash as it was commonly known  mdash was a much too generic name and caused problems with some distributions the other important reason is that the developers think umbrello is a much cooler name s must be owned by you show an overview window for this image the game tells you a map division name and you have to guess its flag the various tasks are displayed in this window along

importing a project as a new module has some advantages you will import all files and folders recursively and the module will automatically be created for you this makes importing large existing projects to the repository easier however there are some disadvantages you cannot use  cervisia s import dialog to add files to existing modules and you can either import the files as text or binary files you can work around this limitation by creating a folder with files of only one of the types or by informing the patterns of the files that should be ignored during the import process any changes do not take effect until the next time make f makefile cvs is run either automatically by the script or manually by the refreshbuild or recreateconfigure options to get to the chart configuration dialog select format chart from the menu or click on the icon in the toolbar you might need to click on the right or left arrow at the top of the dialog to get all pages if the width of

dismiss the wizard and the configure window there are two rectangles below the toolbar title available actions and current actions using the left and right arrows located between the rectangles you can move icons from the available actions group to the current actions group the toolbar will have every icon that is in the current actions box the up and down arrows allow you reposition an icon for a simple short series such as     the drag and copy method is the simplest enter the starting value into the starting cell and the next value of the series into an adjacent cell then select both cells and move the mouse pointer so that it is over the small square at the bottom right corner the cursor will change to a diagonal double headed arrow then hold the left mouse button down while you drag the cells down or across as needed if in the unlikely event that any alarm was not triggered when it should have been you can refresh the alarm list and trigger any missed alarms by selecting actions refresh alarms this causes  kalarm to reload all alarm calendars selects all messages in the current folder the value of userpath or systempath for root user sessions we briefly showed you how to add an account in getting started to change an accounts settings later open up the configure  kopete dialog with settings configure much like the  kde control center the configuration is separated into

number of pixels between the scrollbars and the scrolled window this will remove the mailbox s and all its messages from your imap server if s has subfolders it will still appear as a node in the folder tree you may use new imap subfolder later to add a mailbox with this name what would you like to do in this group you can define a few advanced options for filters that allow you to refine your filtering the annotations found in the project can be inspected in the annotations view it consists of tree tabs current file the annotation found in the current file for you annotations in the project addressed for you the entries are grouped per file all files the annotations found in all the project files grouped by files the annotations are scanned on project and file load for external modifications this way even is somebody adds an annotation outside of  quantaplus it will be recognized as scanning can take some time the information dialog about new annotations addressed for you might appear after some seconds of the project loading program copyright  by reginald stadlbauer  org most of the time a quote is indicated by a prefixed  gt on every line however there are other possible signs if you can not directly recognize a quote the author did not obey the rules of proper quoting and the results are displayed when the test is finished you can click on more to get an additional initially empty rule if you want to define morecomplex patterns and on fewer to remove the last rule clear clears the pattern  ie it removes all but two rules from screen and resets those two must specify one or more directories to dump as of june  the groupware servers that implement this protocol are the opengroupware server and the citadel server an up to date list can be obtained at the groupdav website the configuration dialog has two pages one for font settings and one for the timer webdav allows access to the script which is called to produce a specific page so changes can be made to the script itself it is possible to work on xml languages currently not supported by  quantaplus by creating a dtep package but the creation can be time consuming as you may need to write hundreds of tag files in tagxml format of course there is a nicer way to go by converting the dtd automatically into a dtep package show or hides the display of the form fields of the document you can add zero or more parameters via the libxslt parameters section of dialog this allows you to provide parameter values to the stylesheet if you hover the mouse cursor over the system tray icon a summary

dialog this button opens the select color dialog allowing you to select the color of the working hours background in the agenda view  korganizer will ask you if you want to add as new calendar which adds the calendar file as a new local file resource merge into existing calendar which merges the calendar items into an existing resource or open in separate window which will allow you to view and edit the calendar but will not add to its default view to add the calendar items select one of the two first options and press ok create a new orthographic wireframe view from the left perspective you can now simply press the key combination you want to act as the shortcut for example  ctrl shift s the configure shortcut dialog box will then close by itself as soon as the shortcut is configured raw printer queues are those which do nt touch the print file to transform it to a different file format you need this for example when printing from  windows clients via samba through a  cups server to a pcl printer in this case the  windows side printer driver would generate the finished print file format for the target printer and filtering it through  cups filters would only harm the purpose under certain circumstances if you want to make sure that the file goes to the printer unfiltered by  cups the lpadmin without a  ppd comes in handy fill in each field the dialog takes the informations from  kcontrolcenter if they exist and ensure that the path details are correct as this is where  kpresenter will save your new html files and pictures click on the next when you are done could not set property s in element s to s left click on the file you want to decrypt enter your passphrase and it will be decrypted you can also drag an encrypted text file and drop it into  kgpg s editor window it will then ask the passphrase and open the decrypted text in  kgpg s editor you can even drop remote files you can also use the file decrypt file and choose a file to decrypt return the rayleigh quotient of a matrix and a vector the mini command line  krunner invoked with alt f may also be used to start  ksnapshot you can start ksysguardd at boot time in daemon mode by adding d as the argument in this case you have to select daemon mode at the connection dialog of ksysguard a disadvantage of this connection type is that you wo nt be able to kill or renice a process with the process controller and the data exchange over network wo nt be encrypted as a result daemon mode is not recommended first either make a new presentation or open an existing one then click on file create html slideshow switch the display to the next days view by choosing the view next x days menu item x represents the number of days usually  assume that files are equal if the modification date and file length are equal files with equal contents but different modification dates will appear as different useful for big directories or slow networks enter a hexa adress or select one in the data your question is shown on the top left type your answer in the edit field use quiz check or enter to see if the answer is correct puddles and sand have the same configuration options as each other in addition by clicking on the configure button you can bring up a dialog that will allow you to select which components you want active from a list by checking the box next to the component title you select the component to be put into the side bar and the summary view the component is loaded and its main view is shown in the main window when clicking on its icon in the side pane for the first time by unchecking the check box the component is removed from the side pane and summary view changes become effective by clicking the apply or ok button beware that in disconnected imap data are transmitted from a client to imap server only when the clients connects to check for new mail so if you have your  kontact clients with an interval mail checking of for instance  minutes in the worst case you have a  minutes delay between the event being written and its appearance to the other users click to remove the currently highlighted word or regular expression from the list with  korganizer you can assign a different color to each category if you check this box the event or todo color in the month view will reflect the category color instead of using no color or only the resource color

the fixed stars not the sun so we would like a timescale that removes the complication of earths orbit around the sun and just focuses on how long it takes the earth to spin  degrees with respect to the stars this rotational period is called a sidereal day on average it is  minutes shorter than a solar day because of the extra  degree the earth spins in a solar day rather than defining a sidereal day to be  hours  minutes we define sidereal hours minutes and seconds that are the same fraction of a day as their solar counterparts therefore one solar second   sidereal seconds preexisting

grant taylor author of the linux printing howto collected most of the available information about printers drivers and filters in his database with the emerging  cups concept extending the use of ppds even to nonpostscript printers he realized the potential of this database if one puts the different datablobs with content that could be described along the lines which device prints with which ghostscript or other filter how well and what command line switches are available into ppdcompatible files he could have all the power of  cups on top of the traditional printer drivers this has now developed into a broader concept known as foomatic foomatic extends the capabilities of spoolers other than  cups lpr lpd lprng pdq ppr to a certain degree stealing some concepts from  cups the

so they can be in your server root and easy to upload or you can make them secure to link to below server root which is a very cool trick when linking to a file not in the project templates you will be prompted to copy the file to the project templates prior to linking this will prevent broken links on upload you always have control where you place your templates so you can choose to move them

user  kdesu is an unprivileged program it uses the systems su prevent the user from accessing the terminal or specifying a command line to be executed for example this would disable access to the panels run application dialog  kmousetool clicks the mouse whenever the mouse cursor pauses briefly it was designed to help those with repetitive strain injuries for whom pressing buttons hurts it can also drag the mouse although this takes a bit more practice while experimenting with sed you might come to understand and even like these regular expressions they are useful because there are many other programs that also support similar things a small application that occupies very little memory and screen space and at the same time gives you some useful information or provides a control shortcut for instance the clock applet shows current time and date and even a month diary if you click it and system monitor applet shows how busy your machine currently is in realtime actions may be associated with a mode of the remote control if it is the action will only have effect when the remote control is in that mode actions may also be placed out of any mode such actions will always have their desired effect no matter what mode that remote control happens to be in kcminit executes initialization services during startup initialization services are specified in the desktop files of applications or services via the xkdeinit line if you need to remove an anchor point double click on it again to remove it ctrl g file get new vocabularies assuming youve installed  arts correctly and you still have the codecs installed your previous  kde installation needed chances are this is a small problem with your knotifyrc to confirm this try creating an entirely new user and seeing if system notifications work under the new account if they do try moving your kdehome  share config knotifyrc out of the way for your original user to see if this solves the problem open s and other s

rename layer a backup copy of the text in the composer window can be created regularly this option lets you specify the interval used to create the backup you can disable autosaving by setting it to the value  the query of the current lesson is repeated until all its expressions are known the amount of retries of the current lesson is shown below the progress indicator once the current lesson is finished  parley continues with the next provided that you have set up the query options accordingly file sharing allows you to configure samba microsoft  windows and nfs unix file sharing to make changes in this module you need to have the root or administrator password this is where you would set up whether users are allowed to share files without knowing the root password and which users are allowed to do so you can also configure which folders youre like to be shared using which type of sharing and who is allowed to view these shares  ktimetracker can import and export tasks to minimize your work see other systems maximizes the application window to the whole desktop this item only appears if right clicked on an application window you can also select multiple files and folders by holding the ctrl button while you click on each individual file or folder this enables you to then move or copy multiple files and folders to a different location at one time by using the same method above detects stale source directories in a cvs tree closes the current tab document plugin preview or documentation whether the eventtrapping window of the eventbox is above the window of the child widget as opposed to below it apply filtermacro script on current drawable and close window could not get an iterator for source data model computer users have a very large amount of data to manage some of which is sensitive in particular you will typically have many passwords to manage remembering them is difficult writing them down on paper or in a text file is insecure and using tools such at pgp is tedious and inconvenient the journal view provides a place for you to record your reflections occurrences or experiences you can display the journal view in the main panel if you press the journal view toolbar button or if you choose the view journal menu item if you do not find all your man pages adjust the configuration file  etc manpath config or a file of a similar name depending on your distribution or adjust the environment variables manpath and mansect there is also a list of zoom levels in a spin box on the edit toolbar by default shown at the top of the screen in three

of any object it opens a small window in which you enter the  url of the link and the text you want to appear in the popup menu there is also a pair of radio buttons which allow you to specify whether the  url is an image or an html document so  kstars knows whether to launch the web browser or the image viewer you can use this to add links to files on your local disk so this feature could be used to attach observing logs or other custom information to objects in  kstars your custom links are automatically loaded whenever  kstars starts up and they are stored in the folder  kde share apps kstars in files myimage_url dat and myinfo_url dat if you build an extensive list of custom links consider submitting them to us we would like to include them in the next version of  kstars the debian packages install in accordance with the upcoming fhs file hierarchy standard the work area is the main window in  umbrello and is where the real action takes place you use the work area to edit and view the diagrams in your model the work area shows the currently active diagram currently only one diagram can be shown on the work area at any time the ability to use antialiased fonts and icons requires that you have support in both x and the  qt toolkit that you have suitable fonts installed and that you are using the builtin font serving capabilities of the x server if you still are having problems please contact the appropriate  kde mailing list or check the faq as with the patchmap section it is very important the order of the lines and that they are all there the  keys the  lmb fills in the foreground color the  rmb fills in the background color lets say we want to create a new line edit widget for  kommander based on the  kde widget klineedit using the  kommander widget generator dialog we get something like this in the outputted header file this is the  url eg a folder or a web page where  konqueror will jump to when the home button is pressed the match style list lets  juk know which search method to use the search methods you can use are as follows instead of listing a protocol by name it is also possible to specify a whole group of protocols for that the following groups have been defined in  uml associations are represented as lines connecting the classes participating in the relationship and can also show the role and the multiplicity of each of the participants multiplicity is displayed as a range min max of nonnegative values with a star  on the maximum side representing infinite on the left hand end of each bar you can see some vertical lines by  lmb clicking on them you flatten the bar meaning that it is hidden but can be quickly restored by clicking on the now horizontal lines you can also drag a bar into a new position with these lines the next option you can enable on this page is form completion if you check this box  konqueror will try to remember what you answer to form questions and will try to fill in forms for you with the answers you previously used learning is efficient if you repeat new vocabulary in growing intervals there is a blocking and expiring mechanism for that case so that you are not obliged to modify the settings after each cycle correctly answered expressions are blocked at least for the given time and will only be shown after the period of time defined as expiration time this option is similar to floppy device but for a hard disk drive or partition the amount of slider movement when the slider itself is clicked by the user the program automatically attempts to communicate with outlookreg using ole automation if an error is reported this probably means you do not have outlookreg installed if true new windows will use manual layout by default the key has exactly prefix nbsp nbsp is has anything but prefix nbsp nbsp isnot has at least prefix nbsp nbsp isatleast or has at most prefix nbsp nbsp isatmost the ownertrust given as the value of the config key if more than one prefix ownertrust keys with different prefix values are present in a single group the behavior is undefined it is difficult to understand stars using just the apparent magnitudes imagine two stars in the sky with the same apparent magnitude so they appear to be equally bright you cannot know just by looking if the two have the same intrinsic brightness it is possible that one star is intrinsically brighter but further away if we knew the distances to the stars see the parallax article we could account for their distances and assign absolute magnitudes which would reflect their true intrinsic brightness the absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude the star would have if observed from a distance of  parsecs  parsec is  lightyears or  x  cm the absolute magnitude m can be determined from the apparent magnitude m and the distance in parsecs d using the formula the following settings are also needed and you can find them later if need be in the email application in the preferences and identities commands on the tools menu kopetetex allows scientists and mathematicians to hold conversations using the latex markup language expressions entered within are rendered as a graphic in the chatwindow and can be cut and pasted as the original latex to use this plugin you must have latex installed the free busy information represents an availability schedule by presenting the intervals when one already has previous commitments others can avoid arranging appointments for these periods note that only the times are published not the events reasons or attendees disablenbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp to disable breakpoint at current node each entry in the staticservers list indicates a display which should constantly be managed and which is not using  xdmcp this method is typically used only for local  xserver s that are started by  kdm but  kdm can manage externally started foreign  xserver s as well may they run on the local machine or rather remotely  ktouch is a program for learning to touch type  ktouch provides you with text to train on and adjusts to different levels depending on how good you are it displays which key to press next and the correct finger to use repeat the find downward in the document from the current location to enable regular searching on the kanji dictionary check settings kanjidic print  printers printer_name or print printers printer_name i try checking that you spelt the location correctly remember that capitalisation is significant mydirectory is not the same as mydirectory or mydirectory ii try using the search tool to find your file turn this off to suppress any highlighting of whitespaceonly changes in the text or overviewcolumns note that this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore c c comments are active alarm message windows remain visible until you acknowledge them unless autoclose window after latecancelation time was checked in the alarm edit dialog in the case of a recurring alarm if an unacknowledged message window remains from a previous occurrence of the alarm the existing window is simply popped up when the alarm recurs this avoids having to acknowledge multiple copies of the same message should you not wish or be unable to acknowledge a message at the time it appears pastes the text from the clipboard to the editor allowing  kdesu to remember passwords opens up a small security hole in your system obviously  kdesu does not allow anybody but your user id to use the passwords but if done without caution this would lowers roots security level to that of a normal user you a hacker who breaks into your account would get root access  kdesu tries to prevent this the security scheme it uses is in my opinion at least reasonably safe and is explained here this option lets you add a new tab page to the navigation panel the new page can contain the sidebar media player a konqueror plugin feature or a new folder tree view each of the remaining files on the tape are plainold tar archives you should be able to manipulate them directly with  gnu tar even nongnu tar should work for nonincremental backups the latest on line

alarm edit dialog through which you configure the alarm month  the name of the month message submission problem placing it into your outbox system will attempt to resubmit the message until you delete it some editors on some systems save carriage return r and linefeed  characters at the end of line while others will only save the linefeed  usually  kdiff ignores the carriage return but then files that do nt have equal sizes look equal in side by side comparison when this option is on then the carriage return characters are made visible but are treated as white space this option must be off during a merge default is off you can edit delete and send the articles in this folder this is a comma separated list of charsets to try to convert the remote messages to the current locale this is the default view mode in this mode all the playlists are shown as large icons one above the other in the view mode in  kde the configuration files are easy to edit with a simple editor like  kate as

goodies onto a potatolike guy similarly you have other playgrounds with different themes please note that while you need the  kde  or newer libraries on your system you can still use  koffice in a different desktop environment for example xfce or gnome this view displays all your todos events and journal entries for the dates selected in the date navigator as a list open todos that are not due on the selected dates are not shown this view is good for displaying many different items in a compact fashion it is also useful if your events are spread out over a long time period that would not be displayed completely on the screen when using one of the other views allows you to change keyboard shortcuts for  konversation matches any nonword character  anything but letters or numbers equal to

mentioned above you can link files or folders anywhere it means that the linked folder will appear and behave just like the original in another location without consuming additional space on your harddrive so if you for example have a number of documents and only a few are used regularly you can easily group them in a folder and create links in it pressing it will cause the folder view to cd

provides an interactive environment for coordination and support of peerdirected projects including  and placing particular stress upon  those relating to free software and open source projects such as  kde the second type of memory is called virtual or swap memory this block of memory is actually space on the hard drive the operating system reserves a space on the hard drive for swap space the operating system can use this virtual memory or swap space if it runs out of physical memory the reason this is called swap memory is the operating system takes some data that it does nt think you will want for a while and saves that to disk in this reserved space the operating system then loads the new data you need right now it has swapped the not needed data for the data you need right now virtual or swap memory is not as fast as physical memory so operating systems try to keep data especially often used data in the physical memory allows you to configure sonnet  kde s spellchecker enemies can run horizontally through holes in traditional play but not in kgoldrunner play the trick in several traditional levels depends on releasing an enemy from behind a brick wall when you dig away the bricks he runs out through the hole in some kgoldrunner levels on the other hand you must hide inside or behind a dug brick to escape an enemy number of minutes of typing time before break mode starts  kpresenter presents different types of interfaces for you to interact with the program perhaps the most familiar type of interface is the menu which appears on the top of the  kpresenter window couldnt find a suitable file module for loading s set the document encoding the value must be a valid encoding name like utf string to identify layers by name or by layerstack position numbers example  tty_level is a valid level of input output to use so far we have only discussed the case where edits and unedits are used voluntarily be the developers in addition  cvs supports a model which enforces the usage of these commands the responsible command to switch to this model is cvs watch on which we will not explain further because it is mostly used by the administrator of the repository however the important point from the developers point of view is that when the project enforces edits working copies are checked out readonly that means you cannot edit a file by default unless you use tricks like chmod only when you use advanced edit files the file becomes writable it is made readonly again when you commit the file or use advanced unedit files the first part of this tab works the same as the  java page settings use the leftmost button on the window titlebar to display the window menu choose the resize entry and the mouse pointer will become a doubleheaded arrow move the mouse cursor around to resize and click the  lmb when you are done to release the window the  kate editor is the editing area of the  kate window this editor is also used by  kwrite and it can be used in  konqueror for displaying text files from your local computer or from the network input is videoclips and frames defined via storyboard file specify the storyboard filename in the extras tab by default the keyboard shortcut to send messages is  enter another feature of  kgeography is the possibility of zoom on a map zoom zoom you can click the zoom button and then draw a rectangle to zoom in a part of the map while in zoom mode you can press  rmb to go back to the original map size the original size action has the same effect use the scroll bars the arrow keys or the mouse wheel to move around the zoomed map or use the move action that will allow you to drag the map using  lmb the automatic zoom feature will make the map as big as possible also it is usual to start an answer with a introductionary line something like hint pressing and holding the  ctrl key displays on every button the corresponding keybinding the insert command plugin allows you to insert shell command output into a document open in  kate true if the command specified in the command key should handle info urls is this curve linear spline interpolated or freeform below that you have a drop down box to choose the language for your login box corresponding to setting language in  kdmrc  dcop integration allows  kommander dialogs to control and be controlled in interactions with other  kde applications it is a very powerful feature sftp is a secure file transfer protocol sftp is an interactive file transfer program similar to ftp but it performs all operations over an encrypted ssh transport it may use many of the features of ssh including public key authentication and compression in this exercise you have to solve a given task therefore you have to enter the integer part of a fraction and the numerator and the denominator the difficulty of the generated task can be adjusted by using some options on the left the current model used for plutos orbit is only good for dates within about  years of the present date if you let the solar system clock advance beyond this range you will see pluto behave very strangely we are aware of this issue and will try to improve plutos orbit model soon by clicking on an entry you can see information on it such as the authors details to check that sound is working independently of  arts make sure that artsd is nt running and then try playing sound through xmms or another multimedia application that is nt a part of  kde if that application does nt play sound then your general sound setup is probably broken and its not a  kde problem extension of resulting frames the extension is also used to define fileformat the article view gives you a list of all articles in the selected newsgroup or folder you can change the appearance of this view using the view menu the uppermost row of the view contains the column headers as you see there are many ways in which you can contribute all of them are very important and everyone is welcome to participate save the current project to a database similarly empty rules and actions are removed from the pattern and action list respectively before the filter is saved cancel the paste operation by pressing the skip or skip all button false displays the invisible char instead of the actual text password mode these special printers appear in the user print dialog just like normal printers they are entirely configurable on a peruser basis a render mode is similar to  povray s ini file entries it specifies the image size and quality levels for rendering if you would like to render your scene with different qualities and sizes you can add as many render modes as you need from quick previews to fullscreen high quality images output window plugins can appear in a tab of the editor area or in a

connecting or while playing in your favorite tetrinet server the function will be stored but not be drawn it can be used like any other userdefined or predefined function there is also further information available at the kde accessibility project home page it is a good idea to use the move up and move down buttons to adjust the unwanted application to a lower position in the list rather than deleting the application from the list entirely once you have deleted an application if your preferred application should become compromised there will not be an application to view the data document this tab contains selected entries from  gpgsm s dynamic backend configuration dialog please refer to the  gpgsm manual for a description of these options the most practical way to configure the access to a kolab server is to use the kolabwizard wizard application you can start it from the command line prompt dragging any piece of text onto  kalarm s main window or system tray icon opens the alarm edit dialog and sets the alarm text here is another way to think about it consider the stars near the perimeter of a spiral galaxy with typical observed orbital velocities of  kilometers per second if the galaxy consisted of only the matter that we can see these stars would very quickly fly off from the galaxy because their orbital speeds are four times larger than the galaxys escape velocity since galaxies are not seen to be spinning apart there must be mass in the galaxy that we are not accounting for when we add up all the parts we can see to remove an object that has been dropped in the playground area drag it back from the playground area to the objects area on this tab you can configure which crypto backends are to be used for  openpgp and  smime cryptographic

usb and when the mouse is plugged in the ownership and permissions should be changed so that the user at the console can access the mouse we specify the application interface and method in that order followed by the arguments in the same order that they are shown in kdcop dcop has plenty of other options take a look at the output of dcop help  kxkb is the  kde keyboard layout switching utility it is based on x xkb extension and allows to use different keyboard layouts for inputting text  kxkb features keyboard layout indicator gcompris is free software released under the gpl license in order to support its development this version provides only d of the d activities you can get the full version for a small fee at httpgcomprisnet the gnulinux version does not have this restriction if you also believe that we should teach freedom to children please consider using gnulinux get more information at fsf httpwwwfsforgphilosophy the message sent by s with subject s contains a pgp encrypted part but this crypto protocol is not available the merge output editor window below the diff input windows also has an info line at the top showing output the filename and modified if you edited something usually it will contain some text through the automatic merge facilities but often it will also contain conflicts  kstars displays thousands of celestial objects stars planets comets asteroids clusters nebulae and galaxies you can interact with displayed objects to perform actions on them or obtain more information about them clicking on an object will identify it in the status bar and simply hovering the mouse cursor on an object will label it temporarily in the map doubleclicking will recenter the display on the object and begin tracking it so that it will remain centered as time passes right clicking an object opens the objects popup menu which provides more options you may wish to direct the output from extend_dmalloc to a file since otherwise gdb seems to prompt for a return as if you are at the end of a page print the value that a system file maps via the current catalog could not update outofoffice state this resulting list is active you can doubleclick a line to display or edit the event or todo details get more information about these details in and when you check this option the file status command is started whenever you open a local sandbox this operation cannot be performed in offline mode small when small fonts are used a slider for volume control hint you can hide the label on the slider for example if the mixer takes too much of your screen space weekday  the name of the weekday the local sidereal time is displayed by  kstars in the time info box with the label st you have to unshade the box by doubleclicking it in order to see the sidereal time note that the changing sidereal seconds are not synchronized with the changing local time and universal time seconds in fact if you watch the clocks for a while you will notice that the sidereal seconds really are slightly shorter than the lt and ut seconds you have opened a file that was saved with an old version of planner when loading old files all tasks will use the constraint must start on since the old version did not fully support automatic rescheduling to take advantage of this new feature you should add predecessor relations between tasks that are dependent on each other you can add a predecessor relation by clicking on the predecessor and dragging to the successor after doing this you can remove all constraints by selecting the menu item remove all constraints in the edit menu message property lets you select how your message will be encoded when it is sent allow bit means that  kmail will send your message in bit ascii which means that all special characters such as accented letters will be sent asis if mime compliant quoted printable is selected special characters will be encoded using standard  mime encodings which may be more portable to mailing systems other than bit ascii we recommend to use mime compliant quick start will show you how to toggle four simple options that will let you configure some of  kate s more powerful features right away shortcuts lays out some of the default keystroke shortcuts for those who ca nt or do nt want to use a mouse this retrograde motion of the planets puzzled ancient greek

in kbits you can select if line numbers should be shown for the input files there are several  kde mailing lists each focuses on a different aspect of  kde some are for developers so they are not discussed in detail some of the more important lists that users might be interested in are located at the left of the editing area is a list box containing user defined regular expressions some regular expressions are preinstalled with your  kde installation while others you can save yourself this is done by prepending the character with a backslash  before ejecting a tape you must unmount the tape there are three ways to unmount the tape  kleopatra s main function is to display and edit the contents of the local keybox which is similar to  gpg s concept of keyrings albeit one should not stretch this analogy too much you selected a variable width font because this program does nt handle variable width fonts correctly you might experience problems while editing do you want to continue or do you want to select another font all of the most often used features and functions  cups provides are supported in  kdeprint enable automatic saving of manually opened calendar files in

through the entire list to find the area you need though there is a line edit box at the top of the dialog where you can enter a part of the name of the area you want the list of entries that is displayed is filtered to include only those debug areas that contain the text you have entered  eg entering k does not filter very much at all but entering kont will show you just the  kontact debugging areas as an even quicker way of enabling or disabling debugging output there are also select all and deselect all buttons which will cause  kde to produce a mountain of debugging output or very little could not get info on s toggle whether or not to display row headers similar to other internet applications  ftp uses the clientserver approach  mdash a user invokes an  ftp program on the computer instructs it to contact a remote computer and then requests the transfer of one or more files the local  ftp program becomes a client that uses tcp to contact an  ftp server program on the remote computer each time the user requests a file transfer the client and the server programs cooperate to send a copy of the data across the internet gnomeentry that the file entry uses for entering filenames you can use this property to get the gnomeentry if you need to modify or query any of its parameters in case of any doubt please contact annemarie mahfouf annemarie  fr for more information

blackbird or tabla if this box is checked  knode tries to request new articles from the server when selecting a newsgroup these settings especially make sense when you use  knode together with a local news server downloading the messages obviously only works when the server is reachable for a server which is only reachable via an internet connection this setting rarely makes sense and should stay deactivated set the font of the document the value should be a valid font name for example courier the channel view has two different ways for now to display the played notes you can select them from the channel view options item in the settings menu you can create a number of books in  kjots and each book can contain a number of pages where you actually type your notes each book should be given a name so you can find what you are looking for as should each page although you are nt forced to give a page a name it is sensible to do so when the display is in motion  kstars must recompute the screen coordinates of every object in its database which involves some pretty heavy trigonometry when scrolling the display either with the arrow keys or by dragging with the mouse the display may become slow and jerky because the computer is having trouble keeping up by excluding many of the objects the computational load is greatly reduced which allows for smoother scrolling you can turn off this feature in the configure  kstars window and you can also configure which objects get hidden proxies are programs running on a computer that acts a server on the network you are connected to whether by modem or other means these programs receive  http and  ftp requests retrieve the relevant files from the internet and pass them on to the client computer that made the requests  kmail can also read the signature text from the output of a command thus you can use programs such as fortune to create a new signature text for every message everything the program prints onto stdout is caught and used as the signature text many internet service providers bill their customers based on the number of bytes transferred even more commonly isps offer a flat rate up to some arbitrary transfer limit and then charge more for every megabyte above this limit  kppp shows you your current volume and can help you keep your bills to the minimum of course even if youre not billed based on volume you can turn on volume accounting just to satisfy your own curiosity here you can switch between the spellcheckers you can use international ispell or aspell  kalzium can display the isotopes of a

installed on your box and presently activated for  kde pages showing printer information display only those parts that are valid for the  kde selected print subsystem so if you normally run cups but switched temporarily to generic unix lpd printing which is possible you will see less printer info because lpd is not capable of using the same amount of print settings as are possible in cups each

this section is where you can manage your icon themes and other settings related to icons new icon themes can be downloaded from kdelook org and installed here conversely you can remove icon themes by highlighting them in the list and clicking remove you can also set icon sizes for various uses in  kde and effects to apply to icons add location to event works with add and change the man pages are not perfect they tend to be in depth but also extremely technical often written by developers and for developers in some cases this makes them somewhat unfriendly if not downright impossible for many users to understand they are however the best source of solid information on most command line applications and very often the only source to validate your tagxml files simply click the tools popup dialog at the top of  quantaplus and select validate tagxml a dialog will present itself and you need only to follow the simple directions the full url of the current document or an empty string if the document is unsaved the  kde help system is used to provide access to the base  unix help pages man or info as well as the native  kde documentation provided by the  kde documentation team or the

context menu by clicking on the items or the background with the right mouse button note that we have checked the disconnected imap type account this has the effect that a copy of the groupware data is stored locally to the client under the home folder and it is synchronized every time the client connects this seems very inefficient since your data is duplicated many times ie if you have  users that use  kontact you have  times the data but it is the only way to make things run fast because at every connection  kontact has to fetch all data and have  korganizer and  kaddressbook interpret it if you use disconnected imap data is cached locally and only the delta ie the data that has changed is sent if you only match two characters use detectchars instead of stringdetect the same applies to detectchar cant get the number of rows of data model to compare to in order to successfully use  xsldbg you need  kde libxslt libexslt and libxml installed which are available on a typical  kde installation color and color the color the division has in the map whether and when an account will be disabled if the password expires there is another tab available named loaded extensions this

improved by showing them a picture bad presentations consist of a series of slides full of text the presenter then reads the slide to the audience who have already read it as they can read faster than someone can say it aloud try to avoid writing anything on the slide except a title and a number draw a picture of what you need to say then explain the picture to them that way they do not get ahead of you they can read faster than you can speak remember and you look like you know it you do not know it you are using the picture as a series of prompts a slide should support what you are saying not duplicate it a slide should be the focus of the audiences attention not a distraction if your busy schedule or skills do not permit you to be actively involved in  kde development please consider

good reallife example of the use of this feature is the release of a software project after a major release there are bugs in the code that should be fixed but people want to add new features to the application too it is very hard to do both at the same time because new features usually introduce new bugs making it hard to track down the old ones to solve this dilemma  cvs lets you create a parallel version that we will call the  quot stable release branchquot where you can only add bugfixes leaving the main branch head open for adding new features the vocabulary document area has the appearance of a spreadsheetlike grid the grid consists of cells organized in two columns and a number of rows each column and row has a header the column headers are used to specify the titles of the vocabulary document they can be set by selecting vocabulary column titles the row headers number the rows consecutively click this button to change your own  nickname it appears only when the current

of options which you can change to make  kde work for you as well as the settings which affect the whole of  kde see each application has a set of configuration options which you can access using the menu option settings configure application this is the same for all  kde applications which makes it easy to find the configuration dialog for an application you have not set a suppressions file in

with followon scripts all required libraries as well as  konquest itself can also be found on the  konquest home page broadly speaking each  kde application provides one or more  dcop interfaces which in turn provide methods or if you prefer functions that another application can call so the first step in using  dcop is to find the appropriate method for the task the easiest way to do this is using the kdcop frontend to the available  dcop methods since indi is an independent backend component you can run an indi server on a host without kstars indi can be compiled separately to run on remote hosts furthermore device drivers log messages to stderr and that can be helpful in a debugging situation the syntax for indi server is as following it will give you some choices about how you want

of entries can be locked down by placing i behind the group name  eg a multiplier between x and x will works well for many systems with a multiplier over x the mouse pointer may become difficult to control changes the profile for the current tab if you have additional cursor themes available you can install and remove them using the buttons below the list box note that you cannot remove the default themes it matches literal representations of characters commonly used in program code for example newline or t tab input will be replaced with the selected input see below if the autocorrection feature is not active you can also apply autocorrection check here this is where you would configure  kde to connect to a proxy server rather than directly to the internet once again you would generally leave these options at their defaults unless you really knew what you were doing if you do use a proxy server your network administrator will be able to tell you what details to

different color the colors are chosen to somehow reflect the priority of the status for example a file with a conflict is marked red to show you that you have to resolve a conflict before you can continue working with the file if your folder contains a high number of files you may nevertheless lose the overview to get more concise information about which files have an unusual status simply click on the header of the status column the file list is then sorted by priority so you have all important information at the top of the list to get back to the alphabetically sorted view click on

format of the direct entries is simple either a host name or a pattern which is compared against the host name of the display device alternatively a macro may be used to make the entry match everything the macro expands to patterns are distinguished from host names by the inclusion of one or more meta characters  matches any sequence of  or more characters and matches any single character if the entry is a host name all comparisons are done using network addresses so any name which converts to the correct network address may be used note that only the first network address returned for a host name is used for patterns only canonical host names are used in the comparison so ensure that you do not attempt to match aliases host names from  xdmcp queries always contain the local domain name even if the reverse lookup returns a short name so you can use patterns for the local domain preceding the entry with a character causes hosts which match that entry to be excluded preceding it

keeping the remote file untouched in this case you wo nt need to supply a upload to location just a download from location for the remote file if you plan to use a writable remote resource you will have to supply both locations the reason to have separate locations is that some servers may have an upload queue a place where you need to put the upload file different from where it will be in most cases if you have write access to the remote file the upload to and download from file locations should be the same now that we have taken care of pointing at the moon we next want to make time pass

want click the  lmb to release it we hope that  kommander begins to get the developer support and recognition required to achieve the potential it offers our end goal is to make  kommander useful for novice users to extend and merge their applications at the same time it should become a good prototyping tool also it opens the door to the promise of open source in a new way we know that people can extend our gpld programs but the fact remains very few have the skills with  kommander those numbers see a huge multiplier some applications may be most logical as a  kommander application we already use it in areas we want to allow extensibility in  quantaplus most of the time  knode determines the correct mime type for the attachment if  knode detects it incorrectly you can correct the mime type

into your system create a file in your home directory called xmodmap and add to it the following  knode can handle an unlimited number of news server accounts in addition to your main news server most users do nt need this feature but it can be very useful to if your main newsserver does not provide all groups you want to read typical cases of this are when support groups for commercial software are hosted on a special private server or binary newsgroups which are only available from some servers keymaps are mainly used to map keys in the percussion channel have a look at the distributed maps

an object from within a diagram you are only removing the object from that particular diagram the element will still be part of your model and if there are other diagrams using the same element they will not suffer any change if on the other hand you delete the element from the tree view you are actually deleting the element from your model since the element no longer exist in your model it will be automatically removed from all the diagrams it appears in in addition  unsermake includes support for estimating the progress of the current build procedure  kdesvnbuild takes advantage of this to

text over the sixmonth period the earth has moved through half its orbit around the sun in this time its position has changed by  astronomical units abbreviated au  au is the distance from the earth to the sun or about  million kilometers this sounds like a really long distance but even the nearest star to the sun alpha centauri is about  trillion kilometers away therefore the annual parallax is very small typically smaller than one arcsecond which is only   of one degree a convenient distance unit for nearby stars is the parsec which is short for parallax arcsecond one parsec is the distance a star would have if its observed parallax angle was one arcsecond it is equal to  lightyears or  trillion kilometers astronomers like this unit so much that they now use kiloparsecs to measure galaxyscale distances and megaparsecs to measure intergalactic distances even though these distances are much too large to have an actual observable parallax other methods are required to determine

will want to search for one specific article the  knode search feature is an easy way to do this when you are doing the presentation do not accidently look into the light its easy to do if you are not going to use the machine for a few minutes turn it off practise to get where you are going to stand sorted out check the room you intend to use for electrical sockets and learn how the blinds work and where the light switches are good preparation not only makes you less likely to make mistakes inanimate things can be a nightmare in front of an audience but also gives you confidence always have a

similar if you want to modify an already existing resource here you define the actual access masks for the resource in question the previous example was a simple one and limited to just text however there is also support for showing variable information about objects in a label eg you can construct a label with the text this segment is  units long where  would be dynamically replaced with the length of a specific segment the previous chapter described the user interface various configuration options data editing and the wizard in detail if this is the only commandline option it tries to install all of the modules contained in successfullybuilt except for qtcopy which does not need installation if commandline options are specified after install they are all assumed to be modules to install the date and time are initially unchecked because todos do not have the character of a fixed event some of them do not need a due date at all most of them certainly do not need the exact time of fulfillment if your todo requires exact time maybe it actually belongs to events this feature does not work for modules built using the unsermake build system since this is the default build system for modules that can use  unsermake you would need to disable  unsermake support see example below for more information when a text job message warning or  kde notification message is sent to  ktts it passes through each of the enabled filters you have configured in the screen below the order is from top to bottom after passing through each of the ordinary filters listed in the top portion of the screen text jobs are passed to the sentence boundary detector sbd filters kde notifications warnings and messages never pass through sbd filters unlike ordinary filters the first sbd filter that makes changes to the text stops any further filtering basename for extracted frames framenr and extension is added gopher is an internet information browsing service that uses a menudriven interface users

gopher can tunnel from one gopher to another without the user knowing that the server and or host machine have changed gopher keeps the exact location of computers hidden from the user providing the illusion of a single large set of interconnected menus pencolor sets the color of the pen pencolor takes an rgb combination as input pencolor can be abbreviated to pc filters are useful when exporting your calendar if you use a filter only the filtered visible items will be exported also filters are more effective when the items are already classified and organized in categories as you can easily create filters based on categories this option attempts to interpret text in the selected cells as csv data placing each item into a different cell in the row window title font used in the window

latitudinal latitudelike angle of the equatorial system is called declination dec for short it measures the angle of an object above or below the celestial equator the longitudinal angle is called the right ascension ra for short it measures the angle of an object east of the vernal equinox unlike longitude right ascension is usually measured in hours instead of degrees because the apparent rotation of the equatorial coordinate system is closely related to sidereal time and hour angle since a full rotation of the sky takes  hours to complete there are  degrees   hours   degrees in one

note that because the local time always increases by an hour when moving between zones to the east by the time you move through all  time zones you are a full day ahead of where you started we deal with this paradox by defining the international date line which is a time zone boundary in the pacific ocean between asia and north america points just to the east of this line are  hours behind the points just to the west of the line this leads to some interesting phenomena a direct flight from australia to california arrives before it departs also the islands of fiji straddle the international

sure that replies go to the list instead of individuals so the usefulness of this field is very limited and it should only be used in rare cases it depends on the image but many of the images restrict

about the special capabilities of a printer plus definitions of the postscript or pjl commands to call on a certain capability like print duplexing as the explanation of the acronym reveals ppds were originally only used for  postscript printers  cups has extended the ppd concept to all types of printers ppds for  postscript printers are provided by the printer vendors they can be used with  cups and kdeprint to have access to the full features of any  postscript printer the kdeprint team recommends using a ppd originally intended for use with  microsoft windows nt ppds for nonpostscript printers need a companion filter to process the  postscript print files into a format digestible for the nonpostscript target device those ppd filter combos are not yet available from the vendors after the initiative by the  cups developers to utilize ppds the free software community was creative enough to quickly come up with support for most of the currently used printer models through ppds

it starts up like a lot of other client programs  kppp checks to see if the connection is closed by the server and then stops the current session if a no carrier is detected this then is the real problem when setting up callback no carrier will of course be detected the moment the callback server hangs up the line some servers therefore use a special login program so how do you solve this problem you tell your modem to show carrier up at all times which causes no problems if you tell the client to hang up the line you can do this with the following modem command use this entry to close the program youre using if you have unsaved changes in any files you will be asked whether you want to save them create n workpoints following the outline shape of the layerthe shape detection is

remove an alias select an alias record then click remove  kommander was originally designed around a simple concept that has proven somewhat revolutionary among visual design tools typically these tools allow you to create dialogs and possibly mainwindow interfaces of course a mainwindow interface is the main program window which typically has menus toolbars statusbar and the application area dialogs are child windows which typically do nt have menus and are so named because their purpose is to have a dialog or exchange information between you and the main application the elements on a dialog are called widgets and you hook your program into these widgets  kommander is different because it is inherently nonprogrammatic here it uses the concept of associating text with the widgets on the dialog initially this was called associated text but now it is called kommander text widgets on  kommander dialogs can include the content of other widgets by reference and a widget can reference its own content by use of a special that looks like this widgettext specials are commands with special meaning in  kommander so if you created a dialog with two lineeditwidgets and named the first firstname and the second lastname you could create a button and set its  kommander text to my name is firstname lastname you would need to set widgettext in the first and last name widgets remember we need to tell  kommander to reference the text in them you could run this from a konsole and it would output the string for you so it would reference the first name like so firstname   get the widget named firstnamefirstname   widgettext   get the contents of the lineedit widget so in this case firstname returns eric firstname   widgettext   eric each file and directory that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree you can select an item by clicking it with the mouse once some  linux distributions have tried to stress this point so much that they have disabled the root account

example of a readwrite property is the telescopes right ascension you can enter a new right ascension and the telescope based on current settings will either slew or sync to the new input furthermore when the telescope slews its right ascension gets updated and sent back to the client when configuring an alarm you can choose whether it should repeat and whether the alarm should be canceled if it cannot be triggered at its scheduled time for display alarms you can type in a message text specify a text or image file to display or specify a command whose output should be displayed you can also choose the color of the alarm message and whether to play a sound or speak the message the file associations are organized into several categories and at a minimum you will have currently this guide

a daemon called kdesud the daemon listens to a  unix socket in  tmp for commands the mode of the socket is  so that only your user id can connect to it if password keeping is enabled  kdesu executes commands through this daemon it writes the command and roots password to the socket and the daemon executes the command using su as describe before after this the command and the password are not thrown away instead they are kept for a specified amount of time this is the timeout value from in the control module if another request for the same command is coming within this time period the client does not have to supply the password to keep hackers who broke into your account from stealing passwords from the daemon for example by attaching a debugger the daemon is installed setgroupid nogroup this should prevent all normal users including you from getting passwords from the kdesud process also the daemon sets the display environment variable to the value it had when it was started

and better if they are x pixels and you provide a svg file for it to obtain svg flags of almost all countries in the world and some other divisions you can consult the sodipodi flags collection if you open a c source file a  java source file and an html document in  kate you will see that even though the formats are different and thus different words are chosen for special treatment the colors used are the same this is because  kate has a predefined list of default styles which are employed by the individual syntax definitions this format produces an  html file showing all appointments in the

in  kcontrol and you will find its operation to hopefully be fairly self evident no matter what printing subsystem you use the hero moves towards wherever you place the pointer he cannot move as fast as you can move the pointer but he will try hard to catch up if the pointer is above or below his level he will always go up or down when there is a ladder available or a place to fall into otherwise he will move horizontally until he is below the pointer above it or right at it you can make him follow simple paths like  mdash _bar_ l or u but be careful not to get too many twists and turns ahead of him an application for taking screenshots it is capable of capturing images of the whole desktop a single window or a selected region the images can then be saved in a variety of formats including jpg and png sort data in selected cells see the section sorting data for more details you can search for a string in any textwindow of  kdiff the find command ctrlf in the editmenu opens a dialog that lets you specify the string to search for you can also select the windows which should be searched searching will always start at the top use the find nextcommand f to proceed to the next occurrence if you select to search several windows then the first window will be searched from top to bottom before the search starts in the next window at the top again etc an error message such as unknown host usually means that  konqueror cannot find a connection to the internet or that you have entered an incorrect  url there are several places in  cervisia where you can ask for a window showing the

will make the overwrite button in that dialog the default button optionally on remote displays a close connection item that closes the connection to the  xdmcp server you are currently connected to if you got to this server through a host chooser this will bring you back to the chooser otherwise it will only reset the  xserver and bring up the login dialog again yes to start kstars with a different time date use the date argument followed by a date string like  july   if the final operator is  or  the second argument is interpreted as percentage of the first operand the thumbnail kioslave is not directly useful to a user but if you are a developer you can use it within your own applications to create file previews the following script gets the main image from the user friendly comic strip and sets it as the desktop wallpaper using commonly available tools and a little bit of  dcop opens a dialog for configuring the toolbar you can add and remove toolbuttons for  kpovmodeler s commands with this option in the open file dialog you may choose from a list of installed palettes or browse folders for files you can navigate in articles display an article and open or close threads with your mouse or keyboard opening d contacts will open d new windows as well do you really want to display all of these contacts get the p norm or  norm if no p is supplied of a vector and the final way is by selecting the song from the list of songs of the active collection a login script that prompts for id and password and has loops finally there will be an io slave that will give you access to your print subsystem via  konqueror for example with this you will soon be able to browse your print subsystem from  konqueror through a  url like shortcut such as print  printers printername a kpart will add a virtual folder to the services section of the  konqueror navigation panel giving a nice integrated way to browse and manage your print system via the  url print  manager addtaskqstring taskname

now appear with a diagonal hatch border and with a small black square at each corner and in the middle of each edge you may also have a variety of third party packages and some of these applications are mentioned briefly here but we normally cover only the applications provided as part of a  kde release this is not a judgment on the value of third party applications and in fact many of them are excellent the _bar_ separates the possible keywords you might want to modify this list according to your needs the before the is necessary because otherwise the matches the end of the line you can edit the entries on the conjugation page only when you selected verb as word type the visual page layout vpl editor also known as wysiwyg what you see is what you get allows you to edit a  html or

see everything command line options are provided to enable other programs to start up  kalarm if it is not already running in order to trigger or cancel scheduled alarms or schedule new alarms the reason for using command line options for this purpose is that if  kalarm were started without any command line parameters and then sent dbus requests it would start in its default graphical mode which is clearly undesirable for an interprogram request required when an attr is of the type list the image will be duplicated until it fills the entire desktop the first image will be placed in the upper left corner of the screen and duplicated downward and to the right sorting your articles and choosing sorting criteria is done with the column titles in the article view clicking on a column title makes it the current sorting criterion another click on the same column title changes the order of sorting python scripting in  kig basically allows you to create your own objects from certain parent objects for example if you are a math teacher and you have some fancy way of calculating an interesting point on a conic then instead of messing with complex constructions and macros you could just write down in python code how the point is to be calculated and then  kig will show it for you what are i and m in the execute line click on the first file with the  lmb hold down the  ctrl key and click on the bottom most file the  kget window should look similar to this here you can influence the behavior of  parley when you do not know the answer in time setting this option will cause the sort buttons on the toolbar to perform a casesensitive sort and determine the initial state of the casesensitive checkbox in the sort dialog behind the slash you see the translation of the option as it should be shown in a  gui or web interface duplex there is however one thing that everybody interested in programming for  kde should do subscribe to the developers mailing list to subscribe you have to send an email to  org with the subject subscribe your_email_address the find files tool is a useful method of searching for specific files on your computer or for searching for files that match a pattern an example of this could include searching for files of a particular type or with certain letters in the filename or that contain a certain piece of text in their contents the chart

excluding the two provided by default in  kiten do not please note that some of these settings may depend on your selected icon theme  kde comes with three icon themes by default oxygen monochrome and crystal svg there are additional color themes in the kdeartwork package  kmail does not lock the files in  mail the right panel lists the defined color schemes there are four predefined schemes the default scheme star chart which uses black stars on a white background night vision which uses only shades of red in order to protect darkadapted vision and moonless night a more realistic dark theme additionally you can save the current color settings as a custom scheme by clicking the save current colors button it will prompt you for a name for the new scheme and then your scheme will appear in the list in all future  kstars sessions to remove a custom scheme simply highlight it in the list and press the remove color scheme button this plugin is currently mainly used by kmail but you can also use it in any other kde application that uses kioslave plugins total memory this is the combination of physical and virtual memory move the cursor to the beginning of the line after you have

downwards and immediately emerging from the box similarly to take a snapshot of a region select the region combo box entry and set the snapshot delay to no delay and then click on the new snapshot

configuration page abbreviation for e pson s tandard c odes for p rinters besides  postscript and pcl epsons esc p printer language is one of the best known this is a tougher question the usual answer is that stars get their heat from the thermonuclear fusion reactions in their cores however this cannot be the ultimate cause for the stars heat because a star must be hot in the first place for nuclear fusion to be triggered fusion can only sustain the hot temperature it cannot make a star hot a more correct answer is that stars are hot because they have collapsed stars form from diffuse gaseous nebulae as the nebulous gas condenses to form a star the gravitational potential energy of the material is released first as kinetic energy and ultimately as heat as the density increases the

refers to loading an instance of  konqueror into memory before a user asks to start  konqueror the positive effect of this is that when a user asks  kde to load  konqueror the window appears instantly because most of the application has been preloaded the negative effect is that this instance of  konqueror uses memory that could be used by other programs by default when a user closes  konqueror  kde does not close the instance this means that the next time a user wants  konqueror loaded it is nearly instantanous again thefillintheblank features can be turned on and off in the configuration

which you can take as a starting point see the definite integrals and indices section for details about indices this dialog lets you manage all defined plugins and lets you add new ones we will describe each  gui element in here sub patterns are patterns enclosed in parentheses and they have several uses in the world of regular expressions the merge then was difficult because one contributor had changed many things and corrected the indentation in many places another contributor also had changed much text in the same file which resulted in several merge conflicts in the case of  ipp port  and tcp network appsocket port   kdeprint will try to open the port and if successful send an ippgetprinterattribute request to the printer for newer  hp printers the latter usually works because they support both appsocket and  ipp an unique identification is only guaranteed if you have your own domain even when you do not use  knode for generating your messageids there may be collisions when you are using a local newsserver for example leafnode generates a messageid which it derives from the local hostname you should be able to see three strips each with  sections of cyan magenta or yellow

details that you should know about most important is of course the fact that now many files might be affected by each operation if you do nt have backups of your original data then it can be very hard or even impossible to return to the original state so before starting a merge make sure that your data is safe and going back is possible if you make an archive or use some version control system is your decision but even experienced programmers and integrators need the old sources now and then and note that even though i the author of  kdiff try to do my best i ca nt guarantee that there are no

in the the editor you can then use run run from the menubar or the run from the toolbar to run the code if you like you can score an article or a thread manually with the right mouse button or with the scoring menu  mdash here you can score with watch thread and ignore thread directly apart from scoring manually you can let  knode score the articles with scoring rules automatically you can configure these rules at settings configure knode reading news scoring or at scoring edit scoring rules  mdash the only difference between these dialogs is that the last one has the rulelist next to the rule configuration in the following guide im using the editor that appears if scoring edit scoring rules is chosen many other actions can be applied to the selected items by rightclicking on one of the selected items and choosing the action from the menu which appears the exact contents of this menu depend on the type of files selected so it is called a context menu the standard list words

to bring up the neat titlebar menu when applications specify the attributes of the desired talker they may indicate that certain attributes are preferred over other attributes for example an application may specify that it wishes that a female loud voice speak the text and that the loud attribute is preferred over the female attribute if you had a female soft talker and a male loud talker configured  ktts will choose the male loud talker to do the speaking since language is a critical parameter in making speech understandable it is always a preferred attribute a kindof bulletin board

subsystem this dependency might exist because those features are only implemented there remember  kdeprint is an intermediate layer between  kde applications and the print subsystem but its no replacement for any print subsystem by itself such dependency may exist for another reason that  kdeprint has not yet implemented an interface to all the features of all the subsystems  postscript is most heavily used in professional printing environments such as prepress and printing service industries in the  unix and  linux domains  postscript is the predominant standard as a pdl here nearly every program generates a  postscript representation of its pages once you push the print button let us look at a simple example of handmade  postscript code the following listing describes two simple

in settings configure shortcuts to request the latest version of an event or todo select the item and choose the schedule request update menu item the organizer should then send you back the latest version of the item this serves as the medium by which the rest of the applications in  kde pim can integrate with one another all of the applications in  kde pim can be displayed inside here and you can easily choose which ones to display it also contains a summary page by which you can get a brief overview of events and information in the other components to remove an existing filetype select it from the drop down box and press the delete button be careful when entering the device name  kfloppy will pass the device name as is to the external programs especially it does not check and the external programs do not check either if the device is a floppy drive device if you give your any of your main disk partitions as device it will be accepted if the partition is mounted or if you cannot write on this device you will probably get an error message nevertheless avoiding the worst here is the screen that is presented on startup of  blinken showing the general interface to the application most of the screen is taken up by the device with the  colored buttons with the device controls score counter start button  etc in the center of the screen the current status of the application is displayed on the piece of paper under the device in the corners of the application there are  buttons the selected action cannot be accessed directly from the keyboard if you see this error it is likely that you built conglomerate but did not install it try installing it if you have changed the default setting for the display spec path please double check that as well some  im systems allow you to set a display name that is different to your username such as alice loves crypto if you change a contacts name manually this will override their display name to get it back open the properties dialog for that contact and check the use the name given by the server checkbox you can deselect the text box by clicking away from it inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of object oriented programming in which a class gains all of the attributes and operations of the class it inherits from and can override modify some of them as well as add more attributes and operations

expert some  im systems let you see whether contacts are idle at their computers this option enables you to change the color used for idle contacts key to use the current special on field  the advanced tab allows you to set up some useful options to restrict the search to a subset of your target file tree if you want to run  kfilereplace only over files that have a size in the range of kb  kb then you could use the size options there is also a date option that restricts the search in a temporal range and a last option that allows you to only search for files owned or not owned by a particular user this may be more useful to the system administrators you can delete entries by dragging them onto the trash can area symbolized by an icon depicting a garbage bin when block selection

to solve a practical problem here you choose what color you want you the text in the next message you send to be if you choose a color and click ok the chosen color is added to the input line any text written after this will be in the chosen color until you change the color again note not all users turn on the option to see this a screenshot of the kprinter print command in action in the function you can do all sorts of calculations that you deem necessary using the two arguments if needed you should return the object you want to define in our case this is a point object the two arguments are also point objects and we can use the point coordinate function to define the coordinates of the two given points you can view the differences between the last two revisions of the selected file choosing view last change using  ipp which is really a clever extension to http   cups is able to address all objects related to the printing system via universal resource locators or url s print jobs to be deleted or restarted printers to be queried or modified admin tasks to be performed on the server with  ipp and  cups everything is addressable by a certain url many important things can be done through the web interface to  cups accessible for example with  konqueror  kjumpingcube is a simple tactical game you can play it against the computer or against a friend the playing area consists of squares that contain points each square starts with just one point no owner and a neutral color using settings   configure krdc you can open a dialog to modify the behaviour of  krdc selecting that

this is nearly true so for most purposes geographic coordinates are fine if very high precision is required then we must take the true shape of the earth into account the earth is an ellipsoid the distance around the equator is about  longer than a great circle that passes through the poles the geodetic coordinate system takes this ellipsoidal shape into account and expresses the position on

of the printer database at the linuxprinting org website this setting affects how characters you type are encoded for sending to the server it also affects how messages are displayed when you first open konversation it automatically retrieves this setting from the operating system if you seem to be having trouble seeing other users messages correctly try changing this setting a good time to do this would be if you received a vcalendar with a few entries via email for instance or if you are planning to import your calendar from another application in the latter case the first thing to do is to use that application to export the calendar data in one of the formats above or use a tool to convert from the applications native format if you are migrating from  microsoft outlookreg please

printing and more a typeandsay front end for speech synthesizers actually we are not quite done yet we should probably make sure that the display is using equatorial coordinates before the script tracks the moon with an accelerated time step otherwise if the display is using horizontal coordinates it will rotate very quickly through large angles as the moon rises and sets this can be very confusing and is avoided by setting the view option usealtaz to false to change any view option use the changeviewoption function add this function to the script and examine the function arguments panel there is a combobox which contains the list of all options which can be adjusted by changeviewoption since we know we want the usealtaz option we could simply select it from the combobox however the list is quite long and there is no explanation of what each item is for it therefore may be easier to press the browse tree button which will open a window containing a tree view of the available options organized by topic in addition each item has a short explanation of what the option does and the data type of the options value we find usealtaz under the skymap options category just highlight this item and press ok and it will be selected in the combobox of the function arguments panel finally make its value false or  external tools are user defined you can add edit or remove

problems with large attachments we are working on a solution for this problem for  kde  but currently it temporarily consumes virtual memory of about  times the size of the attachment that means that if you attach a mb file  kmail might temporarily need about  mb of virtual memory  ram  swap space if you do not have enough virtual memory this will lead to problems in the above example d can be copied into all three cells d to d at once by just copying d then selecting the complete cell area d d before doing the paste the parameters tab page will then be displayed to let you enter the

emits thermal radiation a perfect blackbody is one that absorbs all incoming light and does not reflect any at room temperature such an object would appear to be perfectly black hence the term blackbody however if heated to a high temperature a blackbody will begin to glow with thermal radiation this script also illustrates the use of the loopstart loopend structure if something goes wrong during the login procedure for example i mistype the password my isp will print an error message and restart the id password loop by issuing the string id again if the string id is caught before the

gateway for your machine this is the default send and receive messages from your mobile phone if you are having trouble with  quantaplus running properly you should check your path to ensure that the  kde  bin folder is in there also be sure that you do not have any older versions of  kde laying about that appear in path before your  kde  bin folder the same holds true for  qt when enemies die in kgoldrunner play they go back to where they started the level in traditional play they reappear at a random place near the top of the playing area this makes a big difference especially in levels where you have to get enemies to fetch nuggets down for you but also because the enemies keep falling down onto you as fast as you can kill them to begin sending and receiving messages you will only have to change some settings in the identities and network pages disable  lt breakpoint_idgt nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp to disable breakpoint at specified break point number if a mark is in this radio button

already want to start without much knowledge of any of the two softwares here we go now if you follow the steps of this tutorial youll be able to set the ultimate simple scene very widespread among the newbies a sphere over a plane the actual effect of setting these options depends upon the features provided by your keyboard hardware and the x server on which  kde is running as an example you may find that changing the key click volume has no effect because that feature is not available on your system the second case is calling an executable any program that runs on your system is an executable even a script program is run by the scripts interpreter so technically its executed too  kommander can run commands just like the console even if you run it from the menu so for instance if you wanted it to open  gimp you would have a button derive the string gimp and put it in a special like so execgimp just like that you will see  gimp open when using this you could also exec ls l too but you would only see the output if you were running from a console you can also enable the sort users checkbox to have the user list sorted alphabetically if this is disabled users will appear in the order they are listed in the password file  kdm will also autocomplete user names if you enable the autocompletion option update statement must have a where part if you see this error it is likely that you built conglomerate but did not install it try installing it generates a collection of html pages from the website xml description to open another project select open project from the project menu or the open project icon on the toolbar the open project dialog will pop up and allow you to choose the project you wish projects have a webprj extension as you can see there is already some example data present  kchart offers the default toolbar for creating a new chart saving loading and printing the chart the second toolbar offers icons for editing the data configuring the chart or using a configuration wizard you can also switch between different chart types with the rest of the icons note that some of these chart types also have subtypes this chapter gives reallife examples on how to use  kchart in various situations as a standalone application the purpose is to give you some understanding of the way  kchart works and how various parts relate to each other any event can be resized with your mouse simply move the mouse pointer near the top or bottom edge of the event and drag the edge up or down this way you can visually modify the starting and ending time of your

enter a long description of the event in the large untitled rectangle you can write as many details as you wish here for example if the event is say planned general repair of your car you can list all

the grey title area of the component and drag the component to wherever you want it to be note that this positioning is done compared to other components so you can move the mail component to be below the todo component in the view but you cannot place it in a specific position if you have only one component in your summary view the only option is to move it between the two columns of the view two components can either be two in one column or one in each column and so on and so forth whenever you are dragging a component you will see a small preview box following your mouse around showing you the component to see all available command line options type the text you specify for the key is printed completely on the keyboard however for the keytexts shift capslock tab backspace and enter

seems ages when you start but it is very difficult to actually get much across in so short a time get your sheet of paper and a clock with a second hand practise your presentation over and over again this has many benefits firstly you get the timing right if someone says you have ten minutes never go over the allowed time secondly when you actually do it in front of a live audience it will not be the first time you have done that presentation third you get the words right in your own head you will find ways of saying things about the subject if youve heard yourself do this presentation several times you will know what you are going to say next and how you are going to say it you can have more than one event triggered by a single notification as an example it is easy to have a sound played

they become due the  cups module in  kdeprint now contains all and more functions that were provided by qtcups and kups in former  kde versions required to have the properties dialog display a tooltip moves the selected render mode one position up finally you can enter a colon  or comma  separated list of applications that should not be saved in sessions and therefore will not be started when restoring a session for example xterm konsole or xterm konsole the observing list tool is a new feature and is still under development we are planning to add more features such as adding objects to the list by selecting a region in the sky and the ability to save observing lists to disk enter the sound file path or use the button beside the edit box to display a file selection dialog you can listen to the selected file by clicking the play button to the left of the edit field that button then changes function to allow you to stop playing when you have heard enough on video track is foreground on top off video track  is on background set the display of line numbers on or off hold  shift and drag to draw a circle the active event type is important for visualization for  callgrind this is for example cache misses or cycle estimation for  oprofile this is timer in the simplest case you can change the event type via a combobox in the toolbar or in the event type view a first overview of the runtime characteristics should be given when you select function main in the left list look then at the call graph view there you see the calls occurring in your program note that the call graph view only shows functions with high event count by doubleclicking a function in the graph it will change to show the called functions around the selected one to avoid the risk of losing mail if using a local account it is necessary to ensure that  kmail uses the same type of locking as your mail delivery agent this command jumps to the next thread containing unread articles the first unread article is then selected and shown the sequence follows the order of articles in the article view insert an already existing presentation a standard  kde file open dialog will appear allowing you to choose a kpresenter document  kpr or a oasis opendocument presentation  odp which will be inserted after the last slide in your current presentation take over all the squares on the game board if you are using a user build of  kde instead of a system build for which you must be root to install you can use the script to install for you i haven not audited this code and it makes ample use of the system call so i would not recommend running it as root at this point toggle display of the document structure tree please do not forget the prefix argument to configure if your kdedir variable is not set set prefix to whatever folder  kde is installed in this is usually either  usr  opt kde or  opt kde also make sure you do the last step as root an example is filtering messages from mailing lists via listid header into separate folders having found out that a message came from list a means that you can avoid checking the next filter for messages from list b if you have a mouse with only two buttons pressing both the  lmb and  rmb together emulates the  mmb of a three button mouse you can even invert the selection that is deselect all selected files and select those that were previously unselected use the menubar edit invert selection option or ctrl  to do this allows manipulating the first mixer you can set volume levels mute the device change balance retrieve the mixer

xkdekalarmspeak xkdekalarmemailid syntax highlighting is what makes the editor automatically display text in different styles colors depending on the function of the string in relation to the purpose of the file in program source code for example control statements may be rendered bold while data types and comments get different colors from the rest of the text this greatly enhances the readability of the text and thus helps the author to be more efficient and productive additionally if you look at your options with the  rmb you will see complete file management tools for creating folders or copying and pasting templates from one location to another here you can either enter two dates between which the files were created or modified or specify a time period the main window is

program that is beautiful and intuitive without sacrificing power lets you choose your playing skill from a slider this decides how clever the computer opponent will be apsfilter is used mainly in the context of classical  unix printing bsdstyle lpd it is a sophisticated shell script disguised as an allinone filtering program in reality apsfilter calls real filters to do the jobs needed it sends printjobs automatically through these other filters based on an initial filetype analysis of the printfile it is written and maintained by andreas klemm it is similar to magicfilter and mostly uses ghostscript for file conversions some linux distributions like  suse use apsfilter others magicfilter like  redhat some have both for preference selection like bsd  cups has no need for apsfilter as it runs its own file type recognition based on  mime types and applies its own filtering logic indi messages in status bar when checked kstars displays indi status messages in the kstars status bar

time is useful for determining where the stars are at any given time sidereal time divides one full spin of the earth into  sidereal hours similarly the map of the sky is divided into  hours of right ascension this is no coincidence local sidereal time lst indicates the right ascension on the sky that is currently crossing the local meridian so if a star has a right ascension of h m s it will be on your meridian at lst more generally the difference between an objects ra and the local sidereal time tells you how far from the meridian the object is for example the same object at lst one sidereal hour later will be one hour of right ascension west of your meridian which is  degrees this angular distance from the meridian is called the objects hour angle this platform is available to

nt  days long its  days long you still have a calendar drift problem it just takes many centuries to become noticeable and so in  pope gregory xiii instituted the gregorian calendar which was largely the same as the julian calendar with one more trick added for leap years even century years those ending with the digits  are only leap years if they are divisible by  so the years   and  were not leap years though they would have been under the julian calendar whereas the year  was a leap year this change makes the average length of a year  days so there is still a tiny calendar drift but it amounts to an error of only  days in  years the gregorian calendar is still used as a standard calendar throughout most of the world select question  answer from the navigation panel to start a
